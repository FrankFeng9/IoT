<h4>Alarm System</h4>
<p>This project involves creating a home alarm system that utilizes a PIR motion sensor to detect motion and trigger an alarm. 
The system includes a 10-second countdown window for the user to disable the alarm before it activates. </p>

<h4>Mail Notification System</h4>
<p>This project involves creating a battery-powered mail notification system that uses ThingSpeak Alerts API to send an email or tweet to the user when the mailbox is opened. 
The system conserves power by going back to sleep after sending the notification.</p>

<h4>Temperature Monitoring Systems</h4>
<P>This project involves using the web server with high-integrity embedded file system to display a webpage that shows live temperature information.</p>

<h4>Water Control System</h4>
<p>This project involves developing an IoT system to monitor and control a water pump based on water level sensors. It includes a fault indicator for various conditions, 
and MQTT communication for publishing and subscribing to relevant topics to display live information and alerts and enable remote control</p>
